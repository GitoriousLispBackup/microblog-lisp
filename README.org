microblog.lisp

microblog.lisp is a very simple, single-user microblog engine I wrote
in Common Lisp.  I have found microblogs to be a good way to keep
notes and other information about my life, so I created this to have
my own personal microblog.

I originally created this program in Seaside in Pharo, but that
started to really slow down my laptop if I left it running for a
while.  I wasn't sure why, but I decided to rewrite the program in
Common Lisp (using SBCL) after seeing that it was performing much
better in my blog.lisp program.

* Installation

Right now I'm still hacking away on this, and haven't tried to run it
anywhere but my personal laptop yet.  So I don't have good
documentation for how to install and run it yet.  But if you install
its dependencies (listed in the package definition, and probably with
[[http://www.quicklisp.org/][Quicklisp]]) and read [[http://www.adampetersen.se/articles/lispweb.htm][these]] [[http://msnyder.info/posts/2011/07/lisp-for-the-web-part-ii/][two]] articles, you should be able to figure
it out.

I have also only tested and run this with SBCL.  Hopefully it's all
standard Common Lisp, but I'm still new to it so I make no guarantees.

* Contributing

If you somehow found this project and think it's cool and want to
either use it or show me something I've done wrong or add something to
it, I'd love to hear from you.  You can email me at tsmall3@gmail.com
or send me a pull request.
